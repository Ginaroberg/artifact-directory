Title:
Projecting Crop Yields Based on ESM Emulation

Abstract:
The world continues to face the impact of climate change, posing great chal-
lenges, particularly with global agriculture. Policymakers and researchers
need efficient tools to assess crop productivity under certain climate scenar-
ios. Traditional crop modeling approaches offer high accuracy, but are of-
ten computationally intensive and difficult to scale. In response, this study
aims to develop a machine learning-based emulator to predict crop yields,
specifically for maize, rice, wheat, and soybeans using climate and environ-
mental data from Earth System Model simulations. By leveraging models
like Random Forest Regressor and Gaussian Process trained on historical crop
yield and climate data from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison
Project (ISIMIP), we efficiently predict annual crop yields based on key cli-
mate variables such as solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation. Our
approach significantly reduces costs while maintaining accuracy, providing
an easily accessible framework to measure the impacts of climate change on
global food security. Our method aims to improve the ability of policymak-
ers to anticipate agricultural challenges and ensure that food production is
sustainable in a changing climate.
